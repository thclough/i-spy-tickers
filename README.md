There is merit in having a complete understanding of modern techniques and choosing the one most appropriate for a problem. However, as my resolution of these techniques become more sharp, I feel that I outsource more of my problem-solving to off-the-shelf methodology. I have found myself trapped in a cycle of learning without rigorous application. 

For me, there is more pride in creating compared to consuming. As such, I am creating this project to explore NLP (natural language processing) and more specifically NER (named entity recognition). As of the inception of this project, I am not familiar with more complex NLP techniques, including transformer architecture, or even LSTM's as it is ... and neither do I want to be for now. I plan to build a specialized model for identifying public companies mentioned in text through applying original methodology without having more conventional techniques constrain my creativity. Once I have created a working system, I will then move on to learning the more accepted techniques. I'm excited to see what I come up with. Will this be a strength or weakness?
